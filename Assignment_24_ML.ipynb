    "The Elbow Method is a common approach for selecting the number of clusters in K-means. It involves running the K-means algorithm for a range of cluster numbers and calculating the sum of squared distances (SSD) between each data point and its nearest centroid. The SSD is typically plotted against the number of clusters. The idea is to identify the point on the plot where adding an additional cluster no longer significantly reduces the SSD. This point often resembles an \"elbow\" shape, hence the name. The number of clusters corresponding to the elbow point can be considered as a reasonable choice.\n",

    "The Silhouette Score is a measure of how well each data point fits into its assigned cluster. It considers both the average distance between a data point and other points in the same cluster (cohesion) and the average distance between a data point and points in neighboring clusters (separation). The Silhouette Score ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher value indicates better cluster separation and cohesion. By calculating the Silhouette Score for different numbers of clusters, one can identify the number of clusters that maximizes the overall score. This approach helps find a balance between cluster quality and quantity."
