    "\n",
    "Example: To determine whether a person has a certain medical condition based on a diagnostic test. In this example, we'll use the concepts of prior, posterior, and likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior: The prior probability represents our initial belief or knowledge about the likelihood of a person having the medical condition before any diagnostic test results are considered. Let's say we know from previous studies that the prevalence of this condition in the general population is 5%. So, our prior probability of someone having the condition would be 0.05 (or 5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Likelihood: The likelihood is the probability of observing a certain test result given that the person has or does not have the medical condition. Let's assume that the diagnostic test has been evaluated, and its accuracy is known. For simplicity, let's say that the test has a sensitivity of 90%, meaning it correctly identifies 90% of the individuals who have the condition, and a specificity of 95%, meaning it correctly identifies 95% of the individuals who do not have the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider a hypothetical person and calculate the likelihoods:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person has the medical condition, the test will correctly identify them as positive with a probability of 0.9 (sensitivity).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person does not have the medical condition, the test will correctly identify them as negative with a probability of 0.95 (specificity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Posterior: The posterior probability is the updated probability of a person having the medical condition after taking into account the prior probability and the test result. It is calculated using Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "Posterior probability = (Prior probability * Likelihood) / Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the person takes the test, and it comes out positive. We can now calculate the posterior probability of them having the condition using the prior probability and likelihood mentioned earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Posterior probability = (0.05 * 0.9) / Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "The evidence is the probability of obtaining a positive test result, regardless of whether the person has the condition or not. We can calculate the evidence by considering both the true positives and false positives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidence = (Prior probability * Sensitivity) + ((1 - Prior probability) * (1 - Specificity))\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, by plugging in the values, we can calculate the posterior probability.\n",

    "This example demonstrates how the prior probability, likelihood, and posterior probability are interconnected in the context of diagnostic testing and how they can be used to update our beliefs based on new information.\n"

    "\n",
    "Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), also known as Bayesian Networks or Probabilistic Graphical Models, are powerful tools for modeling uncertain knowledge and making probabilistic inferences. They combine probability theory with graphical models to represent complex relationships between variables and capture the dependencies among them.\n",

    "Applications of Bayesian Belief Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Support Systems: BBNs are used in decision support systems to model complex decision-making processes under uncertainty. They help in assessing the impact of various decisions and uncertainties on outcomes and aid in making informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical Diagnosis: BBNs are widely used in medical diagnosis to model the relationships between symptoms, diseases, and test results. They can help in determining the likelihood of different diseases given observed symptoms and test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Assessment: BBNs are employed in risk assessment and risk management in various domains, such as finance, engineering, and environmental sciences. They can model the dependencies among different risk factors and assess the overall risk based on available evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing: BBNs are utilized in natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and information extraction. They can capture the probabilistic relationships between words, topics, and sentiments in textual data.\n",
